Just some random coding thoughts and experiments

## ghostbook

A companion web app for [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/).

I wrote this to teach myself react and JS/TS. After [Anniversary Update 0.3.1.0](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/4972526782644554623)
brought in a major Journal overhault, it's not as useful, but being able to see
which evidence have been eliminated is still pretty good.
